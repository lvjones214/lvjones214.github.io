                    <p>I am studying to become a full-stack coder by being enrolled in the We Can Code IT bootcamp. As I prepare to start a new career, I’m very excited to be emerging in this new field that I’ve learned I truly enjoy. In the past I have
                        been in higher education and in the K-12 education policy space, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but like many the pandemic has caused me to redirect my talents and seek a new path for myself. I feel certain that a career in software
                        development will leverage my love of both data and puzzles. Five years from now, I hope to be established in this new field and finding a way to weave into my career my passion for learning.
